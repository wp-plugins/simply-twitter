Adds a simple Twitter widget to the sidebar.

== Description ==

Adds a sidebar widget featuring your [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) tweets. While there are many Twitter widgets available, this one is lightweight and simple--perfect for people looking for an easy solution with minimal configuring.

The widget puts the JavaScript loads at the bottom of each page so if Twitter.com happens to be down or running slow, your web page won't stall while loading.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `simply-twitter.php` file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Enable the Twitter plugin on the Widget's page.
4. Specify your Twitter username and click Save.
